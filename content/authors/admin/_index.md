    summary: 
      - Under my mentor's guidance, a Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft, I have actively contributed to pioneering the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT across diverse domains. Notably, we harnessed ChatGPT to produce over 200,000 PowerPoint outlines for OfficePlus in more than 20 different fields. 
      - We researched the application of large language models in the field of climate change. Through techniques like fine-tuning, we trained AI for Science to distinguish it from generic large language models.
